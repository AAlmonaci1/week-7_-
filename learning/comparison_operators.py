# Append the value of current to the end of the list seconds Please use the list.append() method to do that.


# seconds = [1.23, 1.45, 1.02]
# current = 1.11
# print(seconds.append(current))

# # Remove item 1.45 from seconds.

# # Remove items 1.45, 1.02, and 1.11 from seconds.

# Comparison Operators Practice  1:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2) with the following values: 36 and 17. Check if num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool
num1 = 36
num2 = 17
my_bool = (num1 >= num2)



# Comparison Operators Practice  2:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):
# Inside num1, store the result of the square root of 25
from math import * 

num1 = sqrt(25)

# Inside num2, store the number 5.
num2 = 5
# Check if num1 is equal to num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
my_bool= (num1 == num2)




# Comparison Operators Practice #3:
# Create two variables (num1 and num2):

# Inside num1, store the result of 64 x 3
num1 = 64*3
# Inside num2, store the result of 24 x 8
num2 = 24*8
# Check if num1 is different from num2 and store the result of that comparison in a variable called my_bool.
my_bool = (num1 != num2)
print(my_bool)



#######################comparison operators challenge#####################
# Challenge: Compare two numbers entered by the user and check if they are equal or not.
# If they are not equal, print which one is greater.

# Prompt the user for two numbers
num1 = input("Please enter one number")
num2 = input("Please enter another number")

# Check for equality and greater number
if num1 == num2:
    print("Your numbers are equal")

if num1 > num2:
   print("Your first number is greater than your second number")
else:
    print("Your second number is greater than your first number")
